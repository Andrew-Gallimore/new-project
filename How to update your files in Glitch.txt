Hello future Andrew, so you have forgoten how to add a new version of your node application (from github) onto your glitch.com page.


Real quick:
-------------------------------------------------------\
Yes, you will have needed to push it to a github repository first, but you can look up guides 
for how to on google, and remember to put "git push -f origin <name-of-branch>" when it comes to that.

Here are the instructions I had used: 
https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line
-------------------------------------------------------/





> What you need to do is go to the GitHub repository.
	Press the green 'code' button and grab the HTTP code.

> Then go to the glitch page you want to change out and manualy delete all the files in it.
	(It will look like there is one final file that won't delete but if you were to refresh you would see it is gone)

> Go to the Terminal, it should be under tools.

> Type "git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/new-project.git ." into the terminal.
                  \_______________________  ________________________/  \
                                          \/                            \
                    This URL will be that HTTP code you got from         \This . is what puts the copy of the repository
			              GitHub earlyer                                        in the main directory and not a new folder


> Now you have the full repository (which if you reloaded would show you the defalt fist one you put in) we need the
  correct branch from inside.
	Go look at the GitHub Repository and find the title of the branch you want and remember it.

> Type "git checkout v1.2" into the terminal.
                     \  /
                      \/
          This will be the title of
             the branch you want

> Finaly you will need to type "refresh" into the terminal to show all the new files on the page.

And your done!
